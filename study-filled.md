flex-direction (this defines the main axis and also its starting point. i.e. left to right, up or down.)
flex-wrap (defines if it remains on one line or flows down or up the page making it dynamic)
flex-flow (shorthand for the two properties above.)
justify-content (this help sets the alignment of items on the main axis of the flex box.)
align-item (defines behaviour and alignment on the cross axis)
align-content (defines behavour when flex is set to be wrapping. doesn't work on single lines)


```

Name the CSS properties of Flexbox Layout that are applicable to the **children** container.

```
order (by default the order is based on the source code. This redefines the order to your choosing)
flex-grow (dictates how the items distribute extra space in the flex box. if one items value is higher, it takes more)
flex-shrink (if items needed to shrink to fit, this dictates spacing they take up)
flex-basis (defines original size of item. if set to auto it will use up extra space based on its flex-grow value)
flex (great shorthand for the free properties above)
align-self (this allows this item to ignore the alignment rules and follow its own ruling.)
